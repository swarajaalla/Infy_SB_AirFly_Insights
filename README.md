✈️ AirFly Insights — Data Visualization and Analysis of Airline Operations
AirFly Insights is a data visualization and analytics project focused on understanding large-scale airline operations through real-world flight data. The project uncovers trends in delays, cancellations, and route performance using modern data analysis and visualization techniques.

🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes over 60 million flight records from the Kaggle Airlines Dataset to identify operational patterns, delay causes, and seasonal variations. The insights aim to help airlines, airports, and analysts make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency and performance.

🧠 Key Objectives
-Clean, preprocess, and structure raw aviation datasets.
-Analyze trends in flight delays, cancellations, and routes.
-Visualize performance metrics using interactive dashboards.
-Derive actionable insights backed by data-driven storytelling.

🧩 Modules Implemented
-Data Acquisition & Understanding — Loading and exploring the dataset.>Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering — Handling missing values and creating derived features.
-Univariate & Bivariate Analysis — Visualizing flight patterns and distributions.
-Delay & Cancellation Analysis — Identifying top delay causes and seasonal impacts.
-Route & Airport-Level Insights — Heatmaps and maps for congestion and performance.
-Final Dashboard & Documentation — Consolidating all visuals into a professional report/dashboard.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium
Dashboard (optional): Streamlit / Power BI
Documentation: Jupyter Notebook,VS Code GitHub, PDF
