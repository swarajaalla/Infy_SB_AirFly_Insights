#AirFly Insights — Data Visualization and Analysis of Airline Operations

🧭 Project Overview


AirFly Insights is a data visualization and analysis project designed to uncover operational trends, delay patterns, and cancellation reasons in large-scale airline flight data.
Using Python and advanced visualization tools, the project aims to help airlines, airports, and analysts understand performance metrics and identify improvement areas through actionable visual insights.


🎯 Project Objectives

Understand and preprocess aviation datasets for analysis.

Explore trends in flight schedules, delays, cancellations, and routes.

Visualize key operational metrics using bar charts, time series, heatmaps, and maps.

Provide meaningful insights for stakeholders such as airline operators and data analysts.

Summarize findings through a final visual report or dashboard.

📊 Expected Outcomes


A well-cleaned and feature-rich dataset ready for visual exploration.

Interactive and static visualizations highlighting airline performance patterns.

Insights into delay causes, seasonal effects, and route-level congestion.

A cohesive storyline supported by visuals and clear data interpretation.

A professional GitHub repository and presentation documenting the entire workflow.

🗂️ Dataset


Source: Kaggle Airlines Flights Data

Contains over 60 million records of flight operations.

Covers multiple years, airlines, airports, and delay types.

Key attributes include: flight date, carrier, origin, destination, delay times, and cancellation codes.


⚙️ Modules Implemented

1️⃣ Data Acquisition and Understanding

Load and inspect airline data using pandas.

Explore schema, datatypes, and missing values.

Perform sampling and optimize memory usage.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

Handle missing or inconsistent values in delay and cancellation fields.

Create derived features such as Month, Day of Week, Hour, and Route.

Format datetime columns and export cleaned data for reuse.

3️⃣ Univariate and Bivariate Analysis

Explore top airlines, busiest routes, and time-based patterns.

Visualize distributions using bar charts, histograms, boxplots, and line plots.

4️⃣ Delay Cause Analysis

Compare delay causes by airline and weather condition.

Analyze Carrier Delay, Weather Delay, NAS Delay, etc.

Visualize average delay times by hour, day, and airport.

5️⃣ Cancellation and Seasonal Trends

Study monthly cancellation trends and their major causes (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security).

Identify seasonal peaks and holiday-related disruptions.

6️⃣ Airport and Route-Level Exploration

Analyze top 10 origin-destination pairs.

Create heatmaps showing delay intensities.

Map busiest airports using Folium or Plotly maps.
