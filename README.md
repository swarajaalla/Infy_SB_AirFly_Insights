 # AirFly Insights: Data Visualization and Analysis of Airline Operations
                     
# Project Statement:
The objective of this project is to analyze large-scale airline flight data to uncover operational
trends, delay patterns, and cancellation reasons using data visualization techniques. The goal
is to help understand airline and airport-level performance and contribute to actionable
insights using visual analysis.

# Expected Outcomes:
• Understand and preprocess aviation datasets for analysis
• Explore trends in flight schedules, delays, cancellations, and routes
• Visualize key metrics using bar charts, time series, heatmaps, maps, and comparisons
• Provide insights for stakeholders including airline operators and analysts
• Summarize findings through a final visual report and presentation

# Modules to be Implemented:
1. Data Acquisition and Understanding
2. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
3. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
4. Delay Cause Analysis
5. Cancellation and Seasonal Trends
6. Airport and Route-Level Exploration
7. Final Dashboard or Report
8. Documentation and Presentation

# Week-wise Implementation Plan
# Milestone 1: Data Foundation and Cleaning
# Week 1: Project Initialization and Dataset Setup:
• Define goals, KPIs, and workflow
• Load CSVs using pandas
• Explore schema, types, size, and nulls
• Perform sampling and memory optimizations
