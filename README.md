## 🧭 Project Overview

**AirFly Insights** is a data analysis and visualization project developed during the **Infosys Springboard 6.0 Internship**.  
The goal of this project was to explore large-scale airline operational data, uncover meaningful insights, and visualize trends in **flight delays, cancellations, and seasonal performance**.

The project demonstrates the **end-to-end data analytics workflow** — from raw data acquisition to dashboard creation — using **Python, Power BI**, and visualization libraries.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze large airline datasets to understand operational efficiency.  
- Identify key factors contributing to flight delays and cancellations.  
- Study temporal patterns such as monthly, weekly, and hourly trends.  
- Build visual dashboards to communicate findings clearly.  
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world data analytics and storytelling.

## 🗓️ Project Timeline (7 Weeks)

### **Week 1 – Data Acquisition and Understanding**
- Imported dataset into Google Colab.  
- Explored structure, columns, and data quality.  
- Checked for nulls, duplicates, and memory usage.  

### **Week 2 – Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**
- Handled missing and inconsistent values.  
- Created new analytical columns: `Route`, `Month`, `DayOfWeek`, and `Hour`.  
- Converted time columns to datetime objects for better analysis.  

### **Week 3 – Exploratory Visual Analysis**
- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis.  
- Visualized top airlines, busiest routes, and monthly flight trends.  
- Compared delay patterns across airlines using bar and line charts.  

### **Week 4 – Delay Cause and Time-Based Trends**
- Studied different delay categories: Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security.  
- Analyzed peak delay hours and days using line and heatmaps.  
- Identified airlines most affected by operational delays.  

### **Week 5 – Route and Airport-Level Analysis**
- Visualized airport-level average delays using heatmaps.  
- Identified top 10 congested routes.  
- Created interactive maps using `plotly` and `folium`.  

### **Week 6 – Seasonal and Cancellation Analysis**
- Studied flight operations by month and season.  
- Analyzed cancellation causes and trends using pie and bar charts.  
- Found that winter months had more weather-related disruptions.  

### **Week 7 – Final Dashboard and Report Compilation**
- Combined all insights into a professional **Power BI dashboard**.  
- Enhanced visuals with consistent color, titles, and legends.  
- Compiled final report and prepared documentation for submission.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

The **Power BI Dashboard** summarizes the complete airline analysis through:
- **Monthly Flight Volume** (line chart)  
- **Cancellation Breakdown** (pie chart)  
- **Top 10 Delayed Routes** (bar chart)  
- **Airline Delay Comparison** (column chart)  
- **Seasonal Trends** (line chart)  

These visuals help stakeholders quickly identify performance gaps, delay hotspots, and seasonal variations.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Carrier and Weather delays** are the major causes of late arrivals.  
- **Evening flights** tend to experience longer delays compared to morning flights.  
- **Winter months** have higher cancellation rates due to weather conditions.  
- **Busy routes** between metro airports show higher congestion and delays.  
- **Some airlines** demonstrate stronger operational consistency across seasons.  

---

## 🏁 Outcomes and Learnings

- Learned **real-world data analysis workflow** — from data collection to visualization.  
- Improved skills in **Python-based data manipulation and storytelling**.  
- Gained hands-on experience using **Power BI** for dashboard development.  
- Enhanced ability to interpret large datasets and extract actionable insights.
